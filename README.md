# Predictive Analytics Project: Predicting the Price of a Used Car in the UK

Used cars are the biggest segment of car sales today, as the market is twice as big as the new car sales market and has grown even bigger due to decreased manufacturing of new vehicles during the global pandemic. With increased competition for used cars, it is essential to ensure the consumer is getting a fair value for the automobile being purchased. Understanding the fair price for a used vehicle is beneficial for the dealership as well as the consumer.  

This Project aims to examine which features of a care are the most important and use them to build a predictive model that will accurately estimate the price of the car.
